# Apex Mocks Examples

This repository has been created to show some most common mocking examples that you may find useful.

All unit tests have been exclusively created from scratch in order to show and explain those examples.

You can find the unit tests examples in the force-app/main/default/classes/ServiceTest.cls class.

You can also create a scratch org and update or run those unit tests, for that you can find a creation script in scripts/scratchOrgCreation.sh
